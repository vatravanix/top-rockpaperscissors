PROJECT START (2025-06-06 20:23:37):

Well, here we go again. I'm not embarrassed to admit that the JavaScript pages so far have given me quiiiiite some trouble. However, the feeling when something finally clicks - and then, miraculously, somehow works - has been the most satisfying feeling so far. I'm planning on really, really taking my time with this project to try and understand what each and every line of code is really doing. I know I'm going to be facing some real failures before I hit the successes, but I feel alright with that. If I can really get this rock paper scissors project to work, I'm going to be really proud of myself. :)

UPDATE (2025-06-06 20:47:36):

I've now completed the HTML boilerplate page, connected it via script src to the external JavaScript page, and tested its functionality via a placeholder "hello world" console.log. I checked it through the Live Server extension and confirmed the console.log came through as expected, so everything looks good to go. I plan over the next few days (life permitting) to work according to the TOP guidance: first focus is the computer response, then the human response, then tracking the scores, then having the responses loop for one round, then, finally, looping through a full game of 5 rounds total. If, in my next session, I can get something like the computer response working, even if not fully complete, I'll be happy with that. If I find myself struggling, I'll carry on through the Codecademy / freeCodeCamp JavaScript courses I've been checking out, to keep exposing myself to opportunities to practise the code and commit it to memory. I've barely achieved anything so far, but I'm still feeling good.
